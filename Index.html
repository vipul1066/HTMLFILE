        <h1>COVID<span style="color:red">-19</span></h1>
        <p><strong>Coronavirus Disease</strong>
            (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
            requiring special treatment.
            However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with
            underlying medical conditions like
            cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious
            illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the
            virus spreads.
            Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly
            fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently.
            Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s
            mouth or nose in small liquid
            particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory
            droplets to smaller aerosols.
            It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay
            home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

    <h3>Cause</h3>
    <p>Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, causes coronavirus disease 2019
        (COVID-19).

        The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people. Data has shown that the COVID-19 virus spreads
        mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads
        by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These
        droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.

        Sometimes the COVID-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to very small droplets or aerosols that stay in
        the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission.

        The virus can also spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes.
        But the risk is low.

        The COVID-19 virus can spread from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. This is called asymptomatic
        transmission. The COVID-19 virus can also spread from someone who is infected but hasn't developed symptoms yet.
        This is called presymptomatic transmission.

        It's possible to get COVID-19 twice or more, but this is uncommon.

        When a virus has one or more new mutations it’s called a variant of the original virus. The omicron (B.1.1.529)
        variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the delta variant. However, omicron
        appears to cause less severe disease. People who are fully vaccinated can get breakthrough infections and spread
        the virus to others. But the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness. This variant also
        reduces the effectiveness of some monoclonal antibody treatments. Omicron has a few major offshoots
        (sublineages), including BA.5 and BA.2.12.1. BA.5 made up about 88% of COVID-19 infections that had genetic
        sequencing in the U.S. in August, 2022, according to the CDC.

        In April, the CDC downgraded the delta variant from a variant of concern to a variant being monitored. This
        means that the delta variant isn’t currently considered a major public health threat in the U.S.

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>The most common things people who become ill with COVID-19 have include:
        Fever or chills,
        A dry cough and shortness of breath,
        Feeling very tired,
        Muscle or body aches,
        Headache,
        A loss of taste or smell,
        Sore throat,
        Congestion or runny nose,
        Nausea or vomiting,
        Diarrhea,
        These symptoms can start anywhere from 2 to 14 days after you’re in contact with the virus.

                    <p class="card-text">Medical masks are surgical or procedure masks that are flat or pleated (some
                        are like cups); they are affixed to the head with strapsa. Wearing a medical mask is one of the
                        prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019- nCoV, in
                        affected areas.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Use Sanitizer</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The use of hand sanitiser can help us fight against the Coronavirus
                        effectively. Health experts recommended using a hand sanitiser that contains 60-95% alcohol
                        against the theCOVID-19 virus. The best ways of protection against COVID-19 infection are:
                        Wearing a mask.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Social Distance</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily through physical contact from
                        person to person. This is why it is important to reduce the ways people come in close contact
                        with one another. An effective way to do this is to stay home as much as possible and avoid
                        crowded, public places where it is difficult to keep a safe space between people.

                        Many communities have limits on how many people can attend events and gatherings or enter
                        restaurants and bars. Many schools​ and universities have reduced close contact by providing
                        online learning. When close interaction with others is likely, such as essential trips to the
                        grocery store or gas station, the CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering over your mouth
                        and nose and staying at least 6 feet away from others. If you expect to attend a gathering, wear
                        a face covering and stay at least 6 feet away from others, as well.

                    <p class="card-text">Self-isolation and quarantine both mean you have no contact with the public.
                        However, quarantine is the term used if you were in close contact (within about 6 feet) of a
                        person with COVID-19 but have yet to test positive. These people are asked to stay away from
                        others for 14 days or longer, to make sure they do not spread the virus during this
                        “pre-illness" or incubation period.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Self-Isolation</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from person to person even before
                        symptoms start. So, if someone in your family starts to feel even slightly ill, run down, tired,
                        or achy, it's important to stay home and practice “self isolation." This means limiting contact
                        with others. If more severe symptoms develop, like a fever, cough or shortness of breath, call
                        your doctor. They will let you know if a COVID-19 test is needed, and what the next steps should
                        be. If it is believed someone in your family has COVID-19, quarantine will likely be
                        recommended.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Why physical distancing is important</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">Physical distancing in indoor and outdoor spaces is an essential way to slow
                        down the spread of COVID-19. And it's important to keep following physical distancing
                        recommendations in your community, whether you're in one of the high-risk groups or not.

                        With limited child care options and people working from home, it may be tempting to let kids
                        gather together. But physical distancing only works if we all participate. And slowing down or
                        preventing the spread of the virus will save lives.</p>

    <h3>Remember</h3>
    <p>
        As the virus that causes COVID-19 continues to spread, it is important to follow recommendations of federal,
        state, and local governments to protect all of us from getting sick. Scientists are working to understand this
        new syndrome.
        We all are responsible for protecting those at higher risky. Steps like physical distancing and wearing cloth
        face
        coverings may feel like an inconvenience, but it's the best way right now to protect our family, friends, and
        neighbors who may be vulnerable.
